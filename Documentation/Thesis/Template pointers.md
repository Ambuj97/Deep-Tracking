- Literature review:
	- Add figures of architectures on literature review
- Methodology:
	- Describe KalmanNet in detail and how the flow is carried out.
	- Describe motivation behind using KalmanNet, how KalmanNet training is done, which architecture was used.
	- Compare previous KG computation and how KG is computed in KalmanNet.
	
	- Describe various experimentational settings, what were the results (MSE for KalmanNet state estimation).
	- Explain how it performed when integrated with SORT and highlight limitations of synthetic dataset for such a complex real-world problem
- Future work:
	- Explain scenarios which were not tackled (moving camera, moving pedestrians).
	- Explain limitations when integrated with SORT code and how improvements can be done



TODO:
- Start with explaining the KalmanNet architecture
	- Highlight limitations of KG computation in traditional KF and then how KalmanNet learns KG from the data based on four features
- Explain the training process
