Innovation:
- The main aspect of the thesis is to try to create a KalmanNet based tracking within SORT instead of Kalman Filter based tracking and propose a data-based KG computation and remove  complex matrix inversions from the KG computation.

Results:
- The KalmanNet training results are in the experimentation section.
