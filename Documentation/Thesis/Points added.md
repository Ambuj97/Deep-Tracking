- Explain the new proposed state vector (x, y, s, r, x', y', s') representing a BB scenario
- Explain the MOT17-02 dataset, number of frames, camera specifications, etc. Issues in real-world data
	- Less examples required for training a NN
	- Not all sequences are of same sequence length
-  Explain why simulation was done for KalmanNet.
- Explain Kalman Filtering and limitations of it
- Why we have proposed the 7 state space model and explain it in methodology
- Explain why synthetic dataset was created, why KalmanNet was trained on synthetic dataset, which scenario was used for baseline model.
- Expand dataset explanation and in synthetic dataset, add the entire process of how dataset was generated.
