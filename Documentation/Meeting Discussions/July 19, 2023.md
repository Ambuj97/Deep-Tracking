What was discussed in the last meeting? 
Discussion last week was on the following points: 
1) Experimentation with the KalmanNet dataset creation and KalmanNet training
2) Documentation on obsidian.
3) Tensorboard integration  

Today's Meeting Minutes: 
Today, following points were discussed: 
1) More experimentation, change learning rate, generate learning curves on tensorboard and document it on obsidian. 
2) Have a look at open source tools for KalmanNet code flow and document it on obsidian. 
3) Keep track of execution time for training. 
4) Go through the integrated SORT-KalmanNet code and observe the results. 
5)  Test the trained 7x7 model and observe the results using the integrated code. 
6) Explore and finetune 7x7 KalmanNet model on real-world pedestrian dataset (MOT17) 
7) Preprocess the MOT17 data and prepare it for training KalmanNet model. 
8) Once the model is re-trained, test it again using the integrated SORT code. 

TODO for coming week:  
As discussed, the major action items for the coming week are: 
1) Experimentation, generation of learning curves, and documentation on obsidian.
2) Go through integrated SORT-KalmanNet code and observe the results.
3) Test the trained 7x7 model with the integrated code and observe the results.
4) Start working with the MOT17 dataset, preprocess the dataset, and train the KalmanNet model.
