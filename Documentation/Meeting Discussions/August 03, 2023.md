What was discussed in the last meeting? 
Discussion last week was on the following points: 
1) Experimentation with KalmanNet training, track execution time
2) Go through new sort code, observe the results, test the code using trained kalman net model on kitti-13 dataset
3) Try to re-train the kalman net model using real-world dataset

Today's Meeting Minutes: 
Today, following points were discussed: 
1) Visualize the dataset and check data sanctity.
2) Store the parameters in a text file and see if they make sense.
3) Generate learning curves using tensorboard.
4) Use Doxygen to generate a flowchart for the project.
5) Try training the KalmanNet model on real-world data. Preprocess the data to get it into KalmanNet training format, use random initial conditions, train the model.
6) How much part can be published as part of the thesis.

TODO for coming week:  
As discussed, the major action items for the coming week are: 
1) Dataset visualization, checking sanctity of the data, create tensorboard loss curves, and store parameters in a text file.
2) Using open source tool, Doxygen to generate flowchart.
3) Train the KalmanNet model on real-world dataset.
