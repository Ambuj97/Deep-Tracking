What was discussed in the last meeting?
Discussion last week was on the following points:
- Create a presentation on SORT, Kalman Filter, and KalmanNet.
- Understand the dataset and try to run it on KalmanNet.
- Create obsidian files and GitHub repository for the code.

Today's Meeting Minutes:
Today, following points were discussed:
- Discussing during the presentation on KF, SORT, and KalmanNet.
- In KF, the covariance matrices have to be defined properly but in KalmanNet, they are learned from the data itself.
- In SORT, during the association process, a matrix of tracks and detections is created with their IOU distances and Hungarian algorithm is used to find the shortest distance and associate tracks with detections.
- The most important task is to create a proper dataset using KalmanNet-Dataset repo.
- Once dataset is created, train the KalmanNet (both architectures 1 and 2).
- Do experimentation. Document it on obsidian.
- Go through the GitHub code on KalmanNet-Dataset and KalmanNet TSP-main and document the code as well on obsidian (inputs, working, outputs, etc.).
- Share the GitHub repo details.
- First, try experimentation and document the results. Later, go through the documents and code collated by the previous student, just for reference.

TODO for coming week:Â 
As discussed, the major action items for the coming week are:
- Experimentation with the dataset creation and training the KalmanNet and its documentation on Obsidian.
