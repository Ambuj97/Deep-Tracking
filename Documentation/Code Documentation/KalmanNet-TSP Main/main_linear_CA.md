#### Purpose:
[[main_linear_CA]].py file is designed to create a linear dataset of constant velocity or constant acceleration.


#### Functioning:
Important steps involved:
1) Initialization of configuration variables/arguments mentioned under variables section.
2) Initialization of state variables, covariance matrices, and other dataset generation variables mentioned under the variables section.
3) An object, sys_model_gen, of the __'SystemModel'__ class is created. The class init() method initializes the instance variables based on the values (F_genbb, Q_bb, H_onlyPos, R_onlyPosBB, args.T, args.T_test) passed during object creation. __'InitSequence'__ method of class SystemModel is called with values (m1x_0, m2x_0_gen). The InitSequence method initializes further instance variables based on the values passed as parameters to the method.
4) If constant velocity model is used, i.e. CV_model is set to True, sys_model object of the __'SystemModel'__ class is created with class init() method initializing the instance variables based on the values (F_CV, Q_CV, H_onlyPos, R_onlyPos, args.T, args.T_test) passed during object creation. __'InitSequence'__ method of class SystemModel is called with values (m1x_0_cv, m2x_0_cv). The InitSequence method initializes further instance variables based on the values passed as parameters to the method.<br>
	Else, sys_model object of the __'SystemModel'__ class is created with class init() method initializing the instance variables based on the values (F_genbb, Q_bb, H_onlyPos, R_onlyPosBB, args.T, args.T_test) passed during object creation. __'InitSequence'__ method of class SystemModel is called with values (m1x_0, m2x_0). The InitSequence method initializes further instance variables based on the values passed as parameters to the method.
1) __DataGen()__ method of [[utils]] python file is called to generate training, cross-validation, and testing input, target, and init datasets. Parameters passed to the method are (args, sys_model_gen, DatafolderName+DatafileName) where args
