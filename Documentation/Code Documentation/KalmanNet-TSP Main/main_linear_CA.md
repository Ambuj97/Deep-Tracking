#### Purpose:
[[main_linear_CA]].py file is designed to create a linear dataset of constant velocity or constant acceleration.


#### Functioning:
Important steps involved:
1) Initialization of configuration variables/arguments mentioned under variables section.
2) Initialization of state variables, covariance matrices, and other dataset generation variables mentioned under the variables section.
3) An object, sys_model_gen, of the __'SystemModel'__ class is created. The class init() method initializes the instance variables based on the values (F_genbb, Q_bb, H_onlyPos, R_onlyPosBB, args.T, args.T_test) passed during object creation. __'InitSequence'__ method of class SystemModel is called with values (m1x_0, m2x_0_gen). The InitSequence method initializes further instance variables based on the values passed as parameters to the method.
4) If constant velocity model is used, i.e. CV_model is set to True, sys_model object of the __'SystemModel'__ class is created with class init() method initializing the instance variables based on the values (F_CV, Q_CV, H_onlyPos, R_onlyPos, args.T, args.T_test) passed during object creation. __'InitSequence'__ method of class SystemModel is called with values (m1x_0_cv, m2x_0_cv). The InitSequence method initializes further instance variables based on the values passed as parameters to the method.<br>Else, sys_model object of the __'SystemModel'__ class is created with class init() method initializing the instance variables based on the values (F_genbb, Q_bb, H_onlyPos, R_onlyPosBB, args.T, args.T_test) passed during object creation. __'InitSequence'__ method of class SystemModel is called with values (m1x_0, m2x_0). The InitSequence method initializes further instance variables based on the values passed as parameters to the method.
5) __'DataGen()'__ method of [[utils]] python file is called to generate training, cross-validation, and testing input, target, and init datasets. Parameters passed to the method are args, sys_model_gen, DatafolderName+DatafileName string.
6) Torch's __'load()'__ method is then used to load the pytorch data stored at DatafolderName+DatafileName location into respective training, cross-validation, and testing input, target, and init variables.
7) If args.randomInit_test and KnownRandInit_test conditions are True, Kalman Filter is evaluated on the test dataset. The __'KFtest()'__ method of  [[KalmanFilter_test]] python file is called based on the parameters (args, sys_model, test_input, test_target, allStates=Loss_On_AllState, randomInit = True, test_init=test_init) which returns the mean squared error losses and Kalman filter output. MSE_KF_linear_arr is an array that stores the MSE loss at every timestep, MSE_KF_linear_avg stores the average MSE loss, MSE_KF_dB_avg stores the average loss in decibels, and KF_out stores the Kalman Filter output. <br> Else, when the random initialization conditions are false, Kalman filter estimation using __'KFTest()'__ method is carried out based on the parameters (args, sys_model, test_input, test_target, allStates=Loss_On_AllState)
8) The next step involves evaluating KalmanNet. An object, KNet_model, of the class KalmanNetNN is created. The __'NNBuild()'__ method of the class is used to initiate neural network construction based on the parameters sys_model and args.
9) An object of Pipeline class, KNet_Pipeline, is created to train and test KalmanNet. __'setssModel()'__ method of the class is used to set the sys_model as the state space model. __'setModel()'__ method of the class is used to set the KNet_model as the neural network model that has to be trained. __'setTrainingParams()'__ method of the class is used to set the arguments stored in args as the training parameters.
10) If KnownRandInit_train is set to True, KalmanNet is trained with known random initial states. __'NNTrain()'__ method of KNet_Pipeline object is used to initialize training with parameters (sys_model, cv_input, cv_target, train_input, train_target, path_results, MaskOnState=not Train_Loss_On_AllState, randomInit = True, cv_init=cv_init, train_init=train_init).<br>Else, training is done with unknown initial state and __'NNTrain()'__ method of KNet_Pipeline object is used to initialize training with parameters (sys_model, cv_input, cv_target, train_input, train_target, path_results, MaskOnState=not Train_Loss_On_AllState).<br>The returned values are MSE loss on training and cross validation datasets and MSE loss in decibels.
11) After training, the trained model is tested using __'NNTest()'__ method of KNet_Pipeline object. If the KnownRandInit_test is set to True, testing is done with known random initial state. The parameters passed to the method are (sys_model, test_input, test_target, path_results, MaskOnState=not Loss_On_AllState, randomInit=True, test_init=test_init).<br>Else, testing is done with unknown initial state and parameters passed to the __'NNTest()'__ are (sys_model, test_input, test_target, path_results, MaskOnState=not Loss_On_AllState). The values returned are MSE loss, average MSE loss, average MSE loss in decibels, output of the KalmanNet, and total runtime.
