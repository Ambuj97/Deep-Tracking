# KalmanNet

## April.3, 2023 Update "Network Initialization"

Use Xavier initialization for GRU layers and use He initialization for FC layers.
(Can mitigate "NaN" initialization problem dramatically)

## Feb.13, 2023 Update "batched"

Support a batch of sequences being processed simultaneously, leading to dramatic efficiency improvement.

## Running code

This branch simulates architecture #2 in our paper. There are main files simulating the linear and non-linear cases respectively.

* Linear case (canonical model or constant acceleration model)

```
python3 main_linear_canonical.py
python3 main_linear_CA.py
```

* Non-linear Lorenz Attractor case (Discrete-Time, decimation, or Non-linear observation function)

```
python3 main_lor_DT.py
python3 main_lor_decimation.py
python3 main_lor_DT_NLobs.py
```

## Parameter settings
